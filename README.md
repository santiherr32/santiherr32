### Hey 👋

#### About me: 

My name is Santiago. I'm a **Full Stack Web Developer**, currently getting educated at SoyHenry. I love taking great ideas and turning them into real life apps with outstanding designs and useful functionality.

Currently I'm making a specialization in **Front End Development** 👨‍💻 because I truly feel passion for beautiful and visually appealing design applied to web and (soon) mobile applications. Alongside this passion, I have **UI/UX** 🌼🖼️ knowledge to complement my skills and stand out in designs creation.

Although I'm more inclined to the client's view, I'm also proficient in the Back End side of web development with technologies like:
* NodeJS
* NextJS 
* Sequelize
* ExpressJS
* SQL
* PostgreSQL.

I'm a fan of online learning 💻 and self growth 💖 as a person. I have particularly adopted a mindset of life-long learning, that's why I'm always willing to learn new skills and languages to excel in an IT career. In fact, I'm currently learning React Native, TypeScript and Flutter.

Pronouns : He / Him.
Fun fact: I may be sarcastic most of the time of you get to know me well.
